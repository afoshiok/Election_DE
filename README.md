# Money + Elections (End-to-End Data Engineering Project)

## At-A-Glance

Election year has finally rolled back around. You know what that means? Millions, if not billions, of dollars are being spent on sending candidates to Capitol Hill and the White House. In 1974, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) was created to oversee every federal election in the United States. As a result of this, every candidate's financial records were made openly accessible to the public. This project will use FEC data to create a dashboard monitoring all election finances in the 2024 election cycle.
